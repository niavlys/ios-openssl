This project provides for the easy inclusion of OpenSLL when building 
Kivy apps for iOS.

    http://kivy.org
    https://github.com/kivy

The project derives from
https://github.com/st3fan/ios-openssl. Please refer here for detail.
This fork adds a script specifically for kivy deployment whilst trying
to make minimal modifications to the original logic.

Thanks and respect.
