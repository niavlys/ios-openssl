About
=====

This project provides for the easy inclusion of OpenSLL when building 
Kivy apps for iOS.

How it works
============

Kivy uses the kivy-ios project to build a Kivy application "distribution"
for iOS. This distribution is built by running the "tools/build-all.sh"
script. This script compiles and packages all of the Kivy dependencies.

By default, this package does not include OpenSLL. In order to include it,
you need to edit the "tools/build-all.sh" file and uncomment the
"build-openssl.sh" line. Uncommenting this line will result in this repo being
cloned locally and used to build the OpenSLL libraries required.

Building in XCode
=================

Once the distribution is built, you need to use kivy-ios to build you XCode
project. Once done, ensure you have a reference to the "libssl.a" and the
"libcrypto.a" files in the "libs" folder in order for the XCode compile to
include these libraries. This is done by going to the "Linked Frameworks
and Libraries" section under the "General" project tab and clicking "+" at
the bottom and then selecting the files.

Note: There is a know bug in XCode that inserts the incorrect path when
browsing to add a library. IF you get a "directory not found" error, please
refer to this url: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19061772/directory-not-found-apple-mach-o-linker-warning-but-library-search-path-and-fram

The project derives from
https://github.com/st3fan/ios-openssl. Please refer here for detail.
This fork adds a script specifically for kivy deployment whilst trying
to make minimal modifications to the original logic.

Thanks and respect.
