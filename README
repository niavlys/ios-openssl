About
=====

This project provides for the easy inclusion of OpenSLL when building 
Kivy apps for iOS.

    http://kivy.org
    https://github.com/kivy

How it works
============

Kivy uses the kivy-ios project to build a Kivy application "distribution"
for iOS. This distribution is built by running the "tools/build-all.sh"
script. This script compiles and packages all of the Kivy dependencies.

By default, this package does not include OpenSLL. In order to include it,
you need to edit the "tools/build-all.sh" file and uncomment the
"build-openssl.sh" line. Uncommenting this line will result in this repo being
cloned locally and used to build the OpenSLL libraries required.

Building in XCode
=================

Once the distribution is built, you need to use kivy-ios to build you XCode
project. Once done, add a reference to the
"libssl.a" file in the "libs" folder in order for the XCode compile to work.

The project derives from
https://github.com/st3fan/ios-openssl. Please refer here for detail.
This fork adds a script specifically for kivy deployment whilst trying
to make minimal modifications to the original logic.

Thanks and respect.
